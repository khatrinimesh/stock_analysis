# Stock Research Framework Decision Tree

## Overview
A concise framework for researching stocks, using a systematic approach that combines fundamental analysis (4M's framework), financial statement review, technical analysis, and position initiation decisions.

---

## Core Framework: The 4M's

```
START: Research a Stock
│
└─→ Apply 4M's Framework
    │
    ├─→ M1: Meaning
    ├─→ M2: Moat
    ├─→ M3: Management
    └─→ M4: Margin of Safety
```

---

## M1: Meaning

```
Understand What the Company Does
│
├─→ What does the company do?
│   └─→ Understand the business model
│
├─→ How does it make money?
│   └─→ Identify revenue streams
│
├─→ Is the business straightforward?
│   ├─→ YES → Continue
│   └─→ NO → Consider if complexity is justified
│
├─→ Is the sector clear and logical?
│   ├─→ YES → Continue
│   └─→ NO → Proceed with caution
│
└─→ Does it have a clear, logical mission statement?
    ├─→ YES → Proceed to M2: Moat
    └─→ NO → Consider dropping or proceed cautiously
```

**Decision Rule:** Ensure the business and sector are straightforward with a clear, logical mission statement.

---

## M2: Moat

```
Assess Competitive Advantages
│
├─→ What makes the company stand out?
│   └─→ Identify unique value proposition
│
├─→ What are the barriers to entry?
│   ├─→ High barriers? → Favorable
│   └─→ Low barriers? → Less favorable
│
├─→ How durable is the business model?
│   ├─→ Durable (long-term sustainable)? → Favorable
│   └─→ Fragile (easily disrupted)? → Less favorable
│
└─→ Competitive advantages assessment
    ├─→ Strong moat identified? → Proceed to M3: Management
    └─→ Weak/no moat? → Consider dropping or proceed cautiously
```

**Decision Rule:** Look for competitive advantages, barriers to entry, and durability of the business model.

---

## M3: Management

```
Evaluate Leadership Quality
│
├─→ Are incentives aligned?
│   ├─→ YES → Favorable
│   └─→ NO → Red flag
│
├─→ Do they have skin in the game?
│   ├─→ Significant ownership? → Favorable
│   └─→ Minimal ownership? → Less favorable
│
├─→ What is their track record?
│   ├─→ Good track record? → Favorable
│   └─→ Poor track record? → Red flag
│
├─→ Are they motivated?
│   ├─→ YES → Favorable
│   └─→ NO → Red flag
│
└─→ Is it a founder-CEO?
    ├─→ YES → Favorable (but can change over time)
    └─→ NO → Still proceed if other factors strong
    │
    └─→ Note: Can lose confidence over time
        └─→ Example: Exiting Tesla after losing confidence in Elon Musk
```

**Decision Rule:** Look for aligned incentives, skin in the game, good track record, motivation, and preferably a founder-CEO (but this can change over time).

---

## M4: Margin of Safety + Fundamentals/Valuation

```
Valuation & Fundamental Analysis
│
├─→ Margin of Safety
│   └─→ Aim to buy well below intrinsic value
│       └─→ Use simple DCF with conservative inputs
│
├─→ Valuation Philosophy
│   └─→ Valuation matters most at extremes
│       ├─→ Not everything
│       └─→ One input among many
│
└─→ Fundamental Checklist (see next section)
```

**Decision Rule:** Aim to buy well below intrinsic value. Use a simple DCF with conservative inputs. Treat valuation as one input that matters most at extremes, not everything.

---

## Fundamental Checklist

```
Review All Three Financial Statements
│
├─→ Income Statement
│   ├─→ Understand profitability
│   ├─→ Revenue growth trends
│   ├─→ Profit margins
│   └─→ Earnings quality
│
├─→ Balance Sheet
│   ├─→ Assess balance sheet strength
│   ├─→ Debt levels
│   ├─→ Net cash position? (ideally)
│   └─→ Asset quality
│
└─→ Cash Flow Statement
    ├─→ Understand cash generation
    ├─→ Free cash flow generation
    ├─→ Is FCF real or driven by aggressive SBC?
    └─→ Cash conversion cycle
```

### Fundamental Criteria

```
Check Against Criteria
│
├─→ Growing profitably?
│   ├─→ YES → Favorable
│   └─→ NO → Clearly heading there?
│       ├─→ YES → Favorable
│       └─→ NO → Red flag
│
├─→ Strong balance sheet?
│   ├─→ YES → Favorable
│   └─→ NO → Assess risk
│
├─→ Net cash position?
│   ├─→ YES → Ideal
│   └─→ NO → Still proceed if other factors strong
│
├─→ Real free cash flow?
│   ├─→ YES (not driven by aggressive SBC) → Favorable
│   └─→ NO → Red flag
│
└─→ Reasonable valuation?
    ├─→ Versus growth rate? → Check
    ├─→ Versus durability? → Check
    └─→ Reasonable? → Proceed to Technical Analysis
```

**Decision Rule:** Favor companies that are growing profitably (or clearly heading there), have strong balance sheets ideally with net cash, generate real free cash flow not driven by aggressive SBC, and trade at a valuation that is reasonable versus growth and its durability.

---

## Decision Point: Deeper Work or Drop?

```
After Initial 4M's + Fundamental Pass
│
├─→ Company deserves deeper work?
│   ├─→ YES → Proceed to Technical Analysis
│   └─→ NO → DROP: Move on to next idea
│
└─→ Factors to consider:
    ├─→ All 4M's check out?
    ├─→ Fundamentals meet criteria?
    ├─→ Valuation reasonable?
    └─→ Worth investing more time?
```

**Decision Rule:** After this initial pass, decide whether the company deserves deeper work or should be dropped.

---

## Technical Analysis (Required Layer)

```
Study the Stock Chart
│
├─→ How does it trade?
│   └─→ Understand price action patterns
│
├─→ What is the current trend?
│   ├─→ Uptrend? → Favorable
│   ├─→ Downtrend? → Less favorable
│   └─→ Sideways/Base? → Context dependent
│
├─→ Identify key levels
│   ├─→ Support levels
│   ├─→ Resistance levels
│   └─→ Breakout/breakdown points
│
└─→ Focus Areas (avoid lots of indicators)
    ├─→ Price action
    ├─→ Volume
    ├─→ RSI
    ├─→ Key moving averages
    └─→ Trend lines
```

### Chart Review Practice

```
Ongoing Chart Review
│
└─→ Review charts daily
    ├─→ Holdings
    ├─→ Watchlist names
    └─→ Build familiarity with their behavior
```

**Decision Rule:** After fundamentals, always study the stock chart to see how it trades, the current trend, and key levels. Focus on price action, volume, RSI, key moving averages, and trend lines. Review charts of holdings and watchlist names daily.

---

## Decision: Initiate Position?

```
Do NOT Buy Just Because It's a "Good Company"
│
└─→ Always Compare to Existing Holdings
    │
    ├─→ Is it a good business?
    │   ├─→ YES → Check technical setup
    │   └─→ NO → DROP
    │
    ├─→ Does it have a good technical setup?
    │   ├─→ YES → Check differentiation
    │   └─→ NO → WAIT or DROP
    │
    └─→ Does it bring something different?
        │
        ├─→ Higher beta exposure?
        │   ├─→ YES → Favorable
        │   └─→ NO → Continue check
        │
        ├─→ Uncorrelated exposure?
        │   ├─→ YES → Favorable
        │   └─→ NO → Continue check
        │
        └─→ Special situation with clear catalyst?
            ├─→ YES → Favorable
            └─→ NO → Continue check
```

### Inclination to Buy

```
Buy Decision Factors
│
├─→ MORE INCLINED to add if:
│   ├─→ Good business ✓
│   ├─→ Good technical setup ✓
│   └─→ Brings something different:
│       ├─→ Higher beta
│       ├─→ Uncorrelated exposure
│       └─→ Special situation with clear catalyst
│
└─→ LESS INCLINED to buy if:
    ├─→ Highly correlated with current positions
    │   └─→ Example: Passing on middling software names
    │       └─→ When already holding GOOGL and AMZN
    │
    └─→ Clearly inferior to what is already owned
        └─→ DROP: Not worth adding
```

**Decision Rule:** Do not buy just because it is a "good company"; always compare it to existing holdings. More inclined to add if it is a good business with a good technical setup and brings something different. Less inclined if highly correlated or clearly inferior to existing positions.

**Note:** For how to size and categorize positions, see separate "Position Sizing" article.

## Key Principles Summary

1. **4M's Framework:** Meaning, Moat, Management, Margin of Safety
2. **Fundamentals First:** Always review all three financial statements
3. **Technical Layer Required:** Study charts after fundamentals
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Never buy in isolation; always compare to existing holdings
5. **Differentiation Matters:** Prefer positions that add something different to portfolio
6. **Avoid Correlation:** Less inclined to add highly correlated positions
7. **Quality Over Quantity:** Drop inferior ideas rather than dilute portfolio

## Notes

- This framework is intended as an easy on-ramp into a broader investment philosophy series
- Management assessment can change over time (e.g., exiting Tesla after losing confidence)
- Valuation matters most at extremes, not everything
- Daily chart review builds familiarity with holdings and watchlist
