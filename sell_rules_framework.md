### Category 4: Tax & Trading Rules

```
Tax & Trading Considerations
│
├─→ Tax-loss harvesting?
│   ├─→ YES → FULL EXIT
│   └─→ NO → Continue to next check
│
└─→ Is this a TRADE (not investment)?
    ├─→ YES → Check trading rules
    │   ├─→ Stop loss hit?
    │   │   ├─→ YES → FULL EXIT
    │   │   └─→ NO → Continue
    │   │
    │   └─→ Before earnings?
    │       ├─→ Implied move exceeds profit cushion?
    │       │   ├─→ YES → FULL EXIT
    │       │   └─→ NO → Continue
    │       │
    │       └─→ Already in a loss?
    │           ├─→ YES → FULL EXIT (avoid compounding loss)
    │           └─→ NO → Continue to trim checks
    │
    └─→ NO (Investment) → Continue to trim checks
```

**Decision Rule:** For trades, exit if stop loss is hit, implied move exceeds profit cushion, or you're already in a loss before earnings.

## Reasons to Trim (Partial Sell)

### Category 1: Position Sizing & Risk Management

```
Position Sizing
│
├─→ Position has become overweight in portfolio?
│   ├─→ YES → TRIM to improve risk balance
│   └─→ NO → Continue to next check
│
└─→ Position dominating your thoughts and mental bandwidth?
    ├─→ YES → TRIM or exit to lower risk and free up mental capital
    └─→ NO → Continue to next check
```

**Decision Rule:** Trim when position size creates risk imbalance or mental burden.

---

### Category 2: Technical Extension & Momentum

```
Stock Extension
│
├─→ Stock very extended?
│   │
│   ├─→ Mid/Large Cap?
│   │   └─→ Price >70% above 200-day SMA?
│   │       ├─→ YES → "Significantly extended" → TRIM
│   │       └─→ NO → Continue to next check
│   │
│   └─→ Small Cap?
│       └─→ Price >100% above 200-day SMA?
│           ├─→ YES → Consider TRIM (context and catalysts matter)
│           └─→ NO → Continue to next check
│
└─→ Trailing stop approach (alternative)
    ├─→ Stock closes below 10-day EMA?
    │   ├─→ YES → TRIM (reduce exposure)
    │   └─→ NO → Continue
    │
    └─→ Stock closes below 20-day EMA?
        ├─→ YES → FULL EXIT
        └─→ NO → Continue to next check
```

**Decision Rule:** Trim when stock is significantly extended relative to its 200-day SMA, or use trailing stops on 10/20-day EMA breaks.

---

### Category 3: Trend Change Signals

```
Change in Character
│
└─→ Stock in uptrend breaks key moving average?
    ├─→ First time breaking 50-day SMA?
    │   ├─→ YES → Signals potential change in character
    │   │   └─→ TRIM: Sell 1/4 to 1/3 of position
    │   └─→ NO → Continue to next check
    │
    └─→ Continue to next check
```

**Decision Rule:** When a stock breaks a key moving average (e.g., 50-day SMA) for the first time in an uptrend, trim 1/4 to 1/3 of the position.

---

### Category 4: Counterintuitive Behavior

```
Bad Reaction to Good News
│
└─→ Stock reacts badly to good news?
    ├─→ Example: Sells off on good earnings report
    │   ├─→ YES → Strong sell indicator → TRIM or FULL EXIT
    │   └─→ NO → Continue to next check
    │
    └─→ Continue to next check
```

**Decision Rule:** Counterintuitive behavior (selling off on good news) is a strong sell indicator.

---

### Category 5: Trading-Specific Rules

```
Trading Rules (for TRADES only)
│
├─→ Position up roughly 20% from entry?
│   ├─→ YES → TRIM: Sell 20-25% of position
│   │   └─→ Move stop loss to breakeven
│   └─→ NO → Continue to next check
│
└─→ Stock runs or gaps up on no news?
    ├─→ YES → Mean reversion risk high → TRIM
    └─→ NO → Continue to next check
```

**Decision Rule:** For trades, trim 20-25% after ~20% gain and move stop to breakeven. Trim if stock gaps up on no news.

---

## Execution Tip: When Trimming

```
Trimming Execution Strategy
│
└─→ Sell highest cost-basis lots first
    │
    ├─→ Benefits
    │   ├─→ Lowers average cost of remaining shares
    │   └─→ In taxable accounts: Reduces immediate tax liability
    │
    └─→ Long-term advantage
        └─→ Lower-cost shares you keep are more likely to qualify
            └─→ For long-term capital gains treatment when eventually sold
```

**Decision Rule:** Always sell highest cost-basis lots first when trimming, especially if planning to hold core position long-term.

## Key Principles

1. **Full Exit for Fundamentals:** Exit entirely if thesis breaks, trust is lost, or interest wanes
2. **Full Exit for Trades:** Strict rules for trades (stops, earnings risk, loss prevention)
3. **Trim for Risk Management:** Reduce size when position becomes overweight or extended
4. **Trim for Technical Signals:** Use moving averages and extension metrics to guide trims
5. **Execution Matters:** Sell highest cost-basis lots first when trimming

## Notes

- This is an initial guide that will be expanded over time
- Context matters: Small caps can handle greater extensions than large caps
- Trailing stops can be used as an alternative to extension-based trimming
- Counterintuitive behavior (bad reaction to good news) is a particularly strong signal
- Mental capital is real: If a position dominates your thoughts, consider reducing it
